{"EventCollection":[{"dockey":"2330037772-Festival-2014 Fall","updatedate":"02/09/2014 3:42:25 PM","publishedby":"gperez","eventId":"2330037772","article":"","title":"Wild Tales","TitleofOriginalWork":"","titleSecond":" Relatos salvajes","country":"Argentina/Spain","year":"2014","runtime":"122","colour":"True","bw":"False","format":"","synopsis":"","language":"Spanish","filmnote":"<p>Revenge is a dish best served wild. As its\r\ntitle suggests, Damian Szifron's latest\r\nfeature, <em>Wild Tales</em>, is a compendium of\r\noutrageously bizarre stories, each more\r\nshocking and hilarious than the last.\r\nBlending subversive black comedy with\r\ndramatically loaded scenarios, Szifron skilfully\r\nweaves together six separate shorts,\r\nunlinked by narrative but unified by a violence\r\nthat simmers on the cusp of explosion.\r\n\r\n<p>The opening short, <em>Pasternak</em>, plays a\r\ngame of chance aboard an airplane whose\r\npassengers discover they all know the\r\nsame failed musician. The flight's surprising\r\nconclusion prepares the viewer for the\r\nnon-stop, suspense-tinged comedy that\r\npermeates the film. Road rage is a trigger\r\nfor hilarity in the short <em>Road to Hell</em>.\r\nUnexpected endings continue in <em>Dynamite</em>;\r\nthe audience will empathize with its eponymous\r\nhero (played by Argentine great\r\nRicardo Darin) and his frustration with\r\ntow trucks and traffic tickets &mdash; even if his\r\nmanner of dealing with them defies social\r\nnorms and safety standards. The final and\r\npossibly funniest short, <em>Till Death Do Us\r\nPart</em>, portrays the mayhem that ensues\r\nduring a wedding reception when the\r\nnew bride discovers that her husband has\r\nrecently cheated on her. Érica Rivas gives a\r\nno-holds-barred performance as a woman\r\nwhose public display of emotion leaves\r\nmany guests requiring hospitalization.\r\n\r\n<p>More than a series of short films\r\nabout frustrated characters on the verge,\r\n<em>Wild Tales</em> is also a portrait of contemporary\r\nArgentina: a society riddled with\r\ncorruption, hampered by bureaucracy, and\r\nbogged down by tradition. Szifron's film,\r\nby breaking down taboos and allowing its\r\ncharacters to say \"fuck it all,\" provides a\r\ncathartic release from the pressures of\r\nmodern-day living &mdash; a release that provokes\r\nunrestrained, double-over-in-your-seat\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DIANA SANCHEZ</strong>","filmpitch":"More than living up to its title, director Damián Szifron’s compendium of outrageous, hilarious and truly bizarre anecdotes offers a subversive, blackly comic portrait of contemporary Argentina.\r\n","rating":"14A","producer":"Pedro Almodóvar, Agustin Almodóvar, Esther Garcia, Matias Mosterinin, Hugo Sigman, Matias Mosteirin","screenplay":"Damian Szifron","animator":"","productionCompany":"Kramer & Sigman Films","executiveProducer":"Pola Zito, Leticia Cristi","writer":"","cinematographer":"Javier Julia","editor":"","productionDesigner":"Clara Notari","sound":"Jose Luis Diaz","music":"Gustavo Santaolalla","cast":"Ricardo Darin, Oscar Martinez, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Erica Rivas, Rita Cortese, Julieta Zylberberg, Dario Grandinetti","officialWebsite":"http://www.sonyclassics.com","facebook":"","twitter":"@sonyclassics","productionInfo":"","canadianDistributor":"Mongrel Media","usDistributor":"Sony Pictures Classics","internationalSalesAgent":null,"USSalesAgent":null,"customCredits":"","subtitles":"False","programmer":"","creationDate":"2014-04-18T12:38:15Z","lastUpdateDate":"2014-07-17T14:29:51Z","eventKey":"","eventtype":"0","V2objectType":0,"V2objectTypeString":null,"pagetype":"G","seasonId":"","Season":null,"SeasonType":null,"rank":"","ratingAgesMin":null,"ratingGradesMin":null,"ratingAgesMax":null,"ratingGradesMax":null,"children":null,"parents":null,"relatedmedia":[{"RelatedMediaID":null,"mediaID":null,"eventId":"2330037772","mediaTitle":null,"mediaDescription":null,"still":null,"original":null,"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.tiff.net/content/carousel/89fb2d2f31457ecfae0adf3a51c5a039.jpg","rank":null,"thumbnail":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.tiff.net/content/carousel/89fb2d2f31457ecfae0adf3a51c5a039.jpg","mediatype":"image","mediaTypeName":null,"creationDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","lastUpdateDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},{"RelatedMediaID":null,"mediaID":null,"eventId":"2330037772","mediaTitle":null,"mediaDescription":null,"still":null,"original":null,"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.tiff.net/website-ui/images/placeholder_film_still.gif","rank":null,"thumbnail":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.tiff.net/website-ui/images/placeholder_film_still.gif","mediatype":"image","mediaTypeName":null,"creationDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","lastUpdateDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}],"schedule":[{"scheduleId":"76319","startTime":"9/5/2014 2:15:00 PM","endTime":"9/5/2014 4:17:00 PM","customDateTime":"","venue":"6","scheduleNotes":"","price":"","scheduleOrder":"0","available":"","eventId":"2330037772","scheduletype":"1","seasonid":"","article":"","title":"Wild Tales","titleSecond":" Relatos salvajes","country":"Argentina/Spain","year":"2014","runtime":"122","filmpitch":"More than living up to its title, director Damián Szifron’s compendium of outrageous, hilarious and truly bizarre anecdotes offers a subversive, blackly comic portrait of contemporary Argentina.\r\n","language":"Spanish","rating":"14A","ratingAges":"","ratingGrades":"","eventKey":"","eventtype":"0","venueName":"Scotiabank 2","venueShortName":"SB02","venueGroup":"Scotiabank Theatre","RelatedMediaID":null,"mediaDescription":null,"thumbnail":null,"scheddate":"05/09/2014","sortime":"201409051415","longdate":"Friday September 5 ","schedtime":"2:15 PM","schedweek":"36","programmeId":"16986","programmeName":null,"ticketKey":"","ticketOptions":"Ticketed,Festival P&I Pass","filmurl":null,"programmes":[{"programmeId":null,"programmeName":null,"programmer":"Diana Sanchez","arrangementType":"Festival","arrangementTypeId":"71","programmeSeries":"Special Presentation","programmeSeriesCode":"1255","season":"2014 Fall","seasonCode":"614","arrangementId":"7263","programmeShortTitle":"sp","programmeKey":null,"programmeDescription":null,"seasonId":"Festival-2014 Fall","rank":null}],"filmCircuitData":null,"printFormat":"","dubbing":"False","subtitledPrint":"True","readerRequired":"False","premiumScreening":"False","foodFree":"False","ext":"False","dropinHours":"False","directors":[{"personId":"92862","firstName":"Damian","middleName":"","lastName":"Szifron","personBio":"<p>Damian Szifron was born in Buenos\r\nAires.
